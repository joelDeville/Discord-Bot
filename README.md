# Discord-Bot
A Discord bot application built using Python and Discord's APIs

This application makes use of Discord's APIs for a simple bot application to be used in servers on Discord.

Uses features such as:
- custom commands
- role checking
- local error logging

Later updates may occur to flesh out more unique features because currently it is a basic bot.

Commands (command prefix is !)
- roll
- random
- create-channel

Anyone looking to use this bot must create a .env file for their bot's token
then load the file into the environment variables.
